Hi! I am a PhD student at [SAIL (Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab)](https://sail.usc.edu), University of Southern California, advised by [Shrikanth (Shri) Narayanan](https://sail.usc.edu/people/shri.html). My research interests include but are not limited to: speech synthesis, computational linguistics, brain-computer-interfaces (BCIs), speech/language decoding from neural signals, and so on.

Prior to that, I worked at Language and Voice Team, Samsung Research for 2.5 years (supervised by [Chanwoo Kim](https://chanwcom.github.io)), focusing on making text-to-speech models more personalized, multi-lingual, multi-style, controllable, on-device-friendly, and secure. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from [Seoul National University](https://snu.ac.kr) with a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a B.A. in Linguistics.
